		<h1>Freifunk Frankfurt</h1>
			<a href="https://ffm.freifunk.net">Freifunk Frankfurt</a> is a non commercial open initiative to establish a free radio network (WLAN) in the metropolitan area of Frankfurt. It is part of the international movement for free and wireless radio networks.
		<h2>Peering Policy AS64475</h2>
			We have an open peering policy and we do not require a written contract. As we are a voluntary project, we prefer to peer with route servers to keep workload low. Please check if you receive our prefixes through them already. However, we would really appreciate receiving additional routes via a private peering if possible. If it is possible for you to support us with transit, this would also help us a lot.

			For more information please check our <a href="https://as64475.peeringdb.com">peeringdb record</a>.
